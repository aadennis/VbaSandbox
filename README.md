# VbaSandbox

## Use Docx, not Docm
If you want to save a `.bas` etc module in a Word doc, then it has to be in `.docm` format. However, `.docm` does not auto-save, plus there are other inconveniences.   
### Compromise
- Save all files as .docx
- Maintain all VBA in here (GitHub)
- Drag the VBA into the .docx as needed for 1-off jobs
- Delete the vba from the .docx once you have finished with it

### Downsides
- You cannot regularly run tidy-up type jobs, e.g. 'Put an underline and page break before every H1 header'. Those have to be dragged in, executed, then deleted from the `.docx`


## VBA execution etc

- alt-F8 - Run macro
- alt-F11 - Open VBA editor

## Flow diagrams
