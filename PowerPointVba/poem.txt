A whisper rides the morning breeze
Through hedgerows stitched with dew and light
The sea half-dreaming folds and frees
Its silver thoughts in quiet flight.
A crow debates the churchyard spire
While nettles guard the garden gate
And somewhere deep in Exmouth's mire
The day begins to contemplate.
